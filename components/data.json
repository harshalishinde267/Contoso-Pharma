        "Brief Summary": "Rationale: RAS 130 is an anti-diabetic agent used to lower the blood glucose level in Type II Diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent diabetes) patients with proper diet and exercise. RAS 130 works by restoring proper response to insulin in the body. RAS 130 acts primarily by increasing insulin sensitivity which improves glycemic index. It is presumed that RAS 130 does not cause cardiovascular side effects if it is given to Type II diabetes mellitus patients leading a healthy life style. Specifically, controlling diet is done according to American Diabetic Association & American Heart Association guidelines and also through doing aerobic exercises. Guideline for aerobic exercise is given in the design of the study.<br />Exercise is helpful in controlling body weight which can lower the risk for heart disease. Diabetes itself is one of the compounding factors for heart diseases. Exercise helps lowering the LDL cholesterol and raising the HDL cholesterol which is required to prevent heart diseases and achieve a better quality of life.",
        "Detailed Description": "Primary Objective - To determine the relatedness of cardio toxicity as a side effect in subjects with DM II who are treated with RAS 130 who either met, or failed to meet the criteria for diet and exercise.Hypothesis I: There will be no evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are determined to have maintained proper diet and exercise 'healthy lifestyle' throughout the study.Hypothesis II: There may be evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are determined to neglect proper diet and exercise 'unhealthy lifestyle' throughout the study.",
        "Secondary Objective": "To determine the effectiveness of RAS 130 on the reduction of blood glucose levels in subjects with DM II. Hypothesis III: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose levels as a single agent. Hypothesis IV: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose in combination with other anti- diabetic agents.",

        "Conditions": "Cancer of the Breast",
        "Locations": "Mumbai, India",
        "Brief Summary": "Traditionally metastatic breast cancer patients are not offered loco-regional treatment except in cases of fungation or bleeding. However, scientific evidence for such omission of loco-regional treatment in metastatic breast cancer patients is lacking. On one hand, studies have shown that removal of primary tumor at times leads to complete disappearance of metastases and improvement in survival in renal cell carcinoma patients. However, such studies have never been performed in other solid tumors. On the other hand, there is a strong body of evidence in experimental settings that show that removal of primary tumor allows growth of metastasis. There is lack of similar data in humans in clinical settings. Offering loco-regional treatment in metastatic breast cancer patients in a setting of randomized controlled trial will help in improving survival of such patients and understanding the natural history of breast cancer.",
        "Detailed Description": "Loco-regional treatment should not be attempted in metastatic breast cancer patients is a traditional teaching, which lacks scientific basis. Omission of loco-regional treatment can not be part of standard care if the scientific evidence is inadequate. Today such a treatment is offered for fungation and/or bleeding.  Studies in metastatic renal cell carcinoma have shown that removal of primary tumor can cause disappearance of metastases [1] and improve survival[2,3]. The exact mechanism of this phenomenon is not understood. Although immunologic mechanisms have been suggested, these remain largely unproven.[1] On the contrary, metastases autonomy hypothesis on animal models suggests that removal of primary tumor renders autonomy to metastases, which start growing rapidly.[4] The suggested mechanism for this is anti-angiogenic/ angiostatic activity of the primary tumor. However, such studies have never been performed in human subjects.  Which hypothesis is true? What does removal of primary tumor cause - suppression or stimulation of growth of metastases? Whether such suppression or stimulation affects survival? These are few questions, which need to be answered to improve our understanding of natural history of breast cancer. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)[5], basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)[6] are some of the angiogenic and proliferative factors which stimulate tumor/ metastasis growth. Angiostatin[7] and Endostatin[8] are the some of the inhibitors of angiogenesis. It is the balance between angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic factors that determines the tumor/metastases growth[7]. Lot of ongoing research[9] is focused on administration of Angiostatin and Endostatin to tilt this balance in favor of anti-angiogenesis. Does removal of the primary tumor change this balance? And what impact this change in balance (if any) have on survival? These questions have not been answered by in-vivo studies in humans. Demonstration of such effects or absence of these effects can help us in refining our therapeutic targets in metastatic patients.",

        "Conditions": "Cancer of the Breast",
        "Locations": "Mumbai,maharashtra, India",
        "Brief Summary": "The advent of mammography and increased awareness of breast cancer has resulted in detection of smaller tumors, the majority of which would not have had metastasized to the axillary lymph nodes. The sentinel node (SN) is presumably the first echelon node in the axillary basin to become involved with metastatic breast cancer cells. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in operable breast cancer has gained popularity since it promises to avoid treatment of the axilla when the nodes are negative for metastasis. Advances in technology (radio-guided SNB) is associated with a risk of false negative SN reporting in 4-12%. The consequence of leaving behind untreated positive non-sentinel nodes in the axilla is a potential risk for axillary recurrence. Axillary sampling is a simple and inexpensive procedure in which level I nodes are removed by a blind dissection. The investigators critically analyzed the efficacy of both the procedures separately in consecutive pilot studies i.e., targeted SNB versus blind axillary sampling. The current study is planned as a prospective comparison study where a patient undergoes both the procedures in the same surgical intervention and thus provides an immediate comparison of the two techniques with respect to their effectiveness.",
        "Detailed Description": "Axillary node dissection in operable breast cancer provides an accurate way of staging the disease. With increased popularity of screening and earlier diagnosis, most women do not harbor axillary metastases, in which case, axillary lymph node dissection could be avoided. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) gained rapid popularity because the technique could predict the presence of metastases in downstream lymph nodes, so that surgery and its associated morbidity could be safely avoided. SNB can be performed with injection of isosulphan blue subdermally and peritumorally alone or in combination with radio-guidance with technetium-99 labeled colloid injection. Radio-guided SNB is superior to the blue dye in identifying the SN, and a combined technique is still better. However, it failed to accomplish its objective in a proportion of cases where the sentinel node could not be identified even with expensive gadgetry like gamma probes. An overview of sentinel node studies showed that the node was found in only 85-90% of patients and the overall sensitivity in correctly predicting the negative axilla by sentinel node biopsy was only 94%. There was a false negative rate of 6.2% wherein the sentinel node was reported negative in presence of metastasis to non-sentinel nodes in axilla. Axillary sampling was a forerunner to the targeted sentinel node biopsy. The main objective of axillary sampling at that time was to detect a positive axilla. More recently it is being tested as an accurate predictor of axillary status for absence of metastasis. After completion of sampling procedure, the remaining axillary tissue will be checked for any other node showing a blue discoloration or radioactivity and the same will be documented as found outside of axillary sampling. Axillary clearance will then be separately completed in all patients by standard technique after extending the incision without waiting for the frozen section report.",

Because of its anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloid, and antioxidant properties, curcumin has shown positive effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a six month human study was conducted with unformulated curcumin showing insignificant trends, due to limited bioavailability and brain permeability of unformulated curcumin. In animal models of AD, oral dosing of solid-lipid curcumin particle (SLCP or Longvida) significantly reduced memory deficit and impacted biomarkers better than unformulated curcumin. This study is to determine the potential efficacy and safety of highly absorbed SLCP curcumin in subjects with AD.",

        "Brief Summary": "Rationale: RAS 130 is an anti-diabetic agent used to lower the blood glucose level in Type II Diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent diabetes) patients with proper diet and exercise. RAS 130 works by restoring proper response to insulin in the body. RAS 130 acts primarily by increasing insulin sensitivity which improves glycemic index. It is presumed that RAS 130 does not cause cardiovascular side effects if it is given to Type II diabetes mellitus patients leading a healthy life style. Specifically, controlling diet is done according to American Diabetic Association & American Heart Association guidelines and also through doing aerobic exercises. Guideline for aerobic exercise is given in the design of the study.<br />Exercise is helpful in controlling body weight which can lower the risk for heart disease. Diabetes itself is one of the compounding factors for heart diseases. Exercise helps lowering the LDL cholesterol and raising the HDL cholesterol which is required to prevent heart diseases and achieve a better quality of life.",
        "Objectives": "Primary Objective - To determine the relatedness of cardio toxicity as a side effect in subjects with DM II who are treated with RAS 130 who either met, or failed to meet the criteria for diet and exercise.Hypothesis I: There will be no evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are determined to have maintained proper diet and exercise 'healthy lifestyle' throughout the study.Hypothesis II: There may be evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are determined to neglect proper diet and exercise 'unhealthy lifestyle' throughout the study.",
        "Secondary Objective": "To determine the effectiveness of RAS 130 on the reduction of blood glucose levels in subjects with DM II. Hypothesis III: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose levels as a single agent. Hypothesis IV: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose in combination with other anti- diabetic agents.",

        "Conditions": "PCOS",
        "Locations": "Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",
        "Brief Summary": "Poly cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, affecting approximately 5%-10% of all females worldwide . PCOS is a hormonal disorder that involves multiple organ systems within the body. Its cardinal features are Hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. Women with PCOS may complains about irregular menstrual periods or heavy menstrual bleeding, infertility, excessive growth of coarse facial and body hair, obesity, oiliness of the skin, seborrhea, and cystic acne.",
        "Detailed Description": "The symptoms of PCOS are anovulation, resulting in irregular menstruation (amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea) ovulation-related infertility, and polycystic ovaries, often associated with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol levels. The level of serum insulin and insulin resistance are higher in women with PCOS (Hyperinsulinemia).Insulin resistance, defined as the decreased insulin mediated glucose utilization it is more common in women with PCOS up to 50 % in both obese and non obese women . It has also been recognized that some women with this syndrome will have PCO without clinical evidence of androgen excess, but will display evidence of ovarian dysfunction .It is believed to be that, the Hyperinsulinemia of PCOS stimulates the androgens production and increase the activity by decreasing the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) thus increasing the free active testosterone level and by the activating the cytochrome P 450 C 17 alpha enzymatic system that controls androgens production.  The diagnosis of PCOS is based on Hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation in the absence of specific pituitary or adrenal disease , and have disrupted ovulatory function with chronic oligomenorrhea (cycle length greater than 35 day) or amenorrhea (cycle length greater than 12 week) and typical appearance of polycystic ovaries by ultrasound according to the criteria of the Rotterdam consensus meeting 2003 for diagnosis of PCOS. The different diagnostic tests needed to adequately assess for the possibility of PCOS e.g. Pregnancy test, TSH level (for Hyperthyroidism), Prolactin test (for Hyperprolactinemia), Total testosterone (for ovarian tumor) and some tests forevaluating the insulin resistance syndrome in women: Waist circumference (greater than 88 cm), Triglycerides (greater than 150 mg/dL), HDL Cholesterol (less than 50 mg/dL), Blood pressure (greater than 130/85) and Fasting glucose (greater than 110 mg/dL). Fasting glucose- to- insulin ratio and 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (2h- OGTT 140 - 199 mg/dL) may be better predictor of insulin resistance .",

        "Brief Summary": "This study is undertaken to compare effectiveness of homoeopathic treatment versus integrated approach of homoeopathy and yoga in the treatment of menstrual disorders in females with Polycystic ovarian syndrome.",
        "Detailed Description": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex metabolic, endocrine and reproductive disorder affecting approximately 5-10% of the female population in developed countries. The developing countries like China and India, undergoing rapid nutritional transitions due to westernised diets and lifestyle also indicate similar prevalence (9.13%). Its prevalence among infertile women is 15%-20%. The aetiology of Polycystic ovarian syndrome remains unclear; however, several studies have suggested that Polycystic ovarian syndrome is X-linked dominant condition.Women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome have abnormalities in the metabolism of androgens and oestrogen and in the control of androgen production. High serum concentrations of androgenic hormones, such as testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), may be encountered in these patients. However, individual variation is considerable, and a particular patient might have normal androgen levels. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is also associated with peripheral insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and obesity amplifies the degree of both abnormalities. Insulin resistance in Polycystic ovarian syndrome can be secondary to a post binding defect in insulin receptor signalling pathways, and elevated insulin levels may have gonadotropin-augmenting effects on ovarian function. In addition, insulin resistance in Polycystic ovarian syndrome has been associated with adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates lipid metabolism and glucose levels. Both lean and obese women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome have lower adiponectin levels than women without Polycystic ovarian syndrome .The diagnostic criteria of the syndrome were revised by the Rotterdam European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), where the following criteria were established: oligo/amenorrhea, clinical and biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and sonographically confirmed Polycystic ovarian syndrome. . Diagnostic criteria for Rotterdam diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome.",

        "Brief Summary": "Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring additional therapy. COPD exacerbations affects the health status and quality of life of affected patients. The inpatient mortality during exacerbation is 3 to 4% while, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality approaches 43 to 46%. Each episode of exacerbation increases the risk of mortality subsequently(1) Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy has established role in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD. But the use of NIV therapy outside of acute exacerbation is uncertain(2) NIV use has been shown to prevent endotracheal intubation and improved hospital and ICU survival. NIV decreases the work of breathing by unloading the respiratory muscles through assisting the inspiratory phases and counterbalancing the intrinistic positive end expiratory positive pressure (ipeep)(3).",
        "Detailed Description": "Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are periods of acute worsening during the course of illness which increase hospital admission and mortality. Intensive care unit admission and mortality are higher among elderly and those with co-morbidities(9). Non-invasive methods of ventilation can be used in mild to moderate exacerbation of COPD. They prevent most of the complications of invasive mechanical ventilation and has also reduces mortality in acute exacerbations of COPD. In mild to moderate COPD exacerbations(pH-7.25 to 7.35), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) failure rate is found to be 15% to 20%. In severe COPD exacerbations, NIV failure rate approaches upto 52% to 62%(9).",
