            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <h4>Brief Summary</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Curcumin is shown to impact several different pathways of neuroprotection, however clinical trials have not shown positive results, due to the poor bioavailability of curcumin. This study is designed to determine efficacy and safety of high-bioavailability curcumin formulation (Longvida) in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
            <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Curcumin is a polyphenolic molecule that comprises approximately 3-5% of turmeric (Curcuma longa) root, giving the spice its characteristic yellow color. Because of its anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloid, and antioxidant properties, curcumin has shown positive effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a six month human study was conducted with unformulated curcumin showing insignificant trends, due to limited bioavailability and brain permeability of unformulated curcumin. In animal models of AD, oral dosing of solid-lipid curcumin particle (SLCP or Longvida) significantly reduced memory deficit and impacted biomarkers better than unformulated curcumin. This study is to determine the potential efficacy and safety of highly absorbed SLCP curcumin in subjects with AD.</p>
