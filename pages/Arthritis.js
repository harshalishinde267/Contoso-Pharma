            <h4>Brief Summary</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the role of pulse steroids in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but no consensus exists. The aim of this study is to study the efficacy of various treatment regimens in early RA. Methods: This is a randomized open-labeled trial. Patients were randomised into three groups. In group A, patients were treated with single drug (methotrexate 15 mg/wk). The patients in Group B were treated with a combination of DMARDS (Methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine). The patients in Group C received combination therapy as in group B and 3 pulses of methylprednisolone intravenously.</p>
