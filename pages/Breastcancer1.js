            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <h4>Brief Summary</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>The advent of mammography and increased awareness of breast cancer has resulted in detection of smaller tumors, the majority of which would not have had metastasized to the axillary lymph nodes. The sentinel node (SN) is presumably the first echelon node in the axillary basin to become involved with metastatic breast cancer cells. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in operable breast cancer has gained popularity since it promises to avoid treatment of the axilla when the nodes are negative for metastasis. Advances in technology (radio-guided SNB) is associated with a risk of false negative SN reporting in 4-12%. The consequence of leaving behind untreated positive non-sentinel nodes in the axilla is a potential risk for axillary recurrence. Axillary sampling is a simple and inexpensive procedure in which level I nodes are removed by a blind dissection. The investigators critically analyzed the efficacy of both the procedures separately in consecutive pilot studies i.e., targeted SNB versus blind axillary sampling. The current study is planned as a prospective comparison study where a patient undergoes both the procedures in the same surgical intervention and thus provides an immediate comparison of the two techniques with respect to their effectiveness.</p>

            <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>Axillary node dissection in operable breast cancer provides an accurate way of staging the disease. With increased popularity of screening and earlier diagnosis, most women do not harbor axillary metastases, in which case, axillary lymph node dissection could be avoided. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) gained rapid popularity because the technique could predict the presence of metastases in downstream lymph nodes, so that surgery and its associated morbidity could be safely avoided. SNB can be performed with injection of isosulphan blue subdermally and peritumorally alone or in combination with radio-guidance with technetium-99 labeled colloid injection. Radio-guided SNB is superior to the blue dye in identifying the SN, and a combined technique is still better. However, it failed to accomplish its objective in a proportion of cases where the sentinel node could not be identified even with expensive gadgetry like gamma probes. An overview of sentinel node studies showed that the node was found in only 85-90% of patients and the overall sensitivity in correctly predicting the negative axilla by sentinel node biopsy was only 94%. There was a false negative rate of 6.2% wherein the sentinel node was reported negative in presence of metastasis to non-sentinel nodes in axilla.</p>
            <p>Axillary sampling was a forerunner to the targeted sentinel node biopsy. The main objective of axillary sampling at that time was to detect a positive axilla. More recently it is being tested as an accurate predictor of axillary status for absence of metastasis.</p>
            <p>After completion of sampling procedure, the remaining axillary tissue will be checked for any other node showing a blue discoloration or radioactivity and the same will be documented as found outside of axillary sampling. Axillary clearance will then be separately completed in all patients by standard technique after extending the incision without waiting for the frozen section report.</p>
