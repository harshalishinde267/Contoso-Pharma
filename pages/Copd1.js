            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <h4>Brief Summary</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring additional therapy. COPD exacerbations affects the health status and quality of life of affected patients. The inpatient mortality during exacerbation is 3 to 4% while, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality approaches 43 to 46%. Each episode of exacerbation increases the risk of mortality subsequently(1) Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy has established role in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD. But the use of NIV therapy outside of acute exacerbation is uncertain(2) NIV use has been shown to prevent endotracheal intubation and improved hospital and ICU survival. NIV decreases the work of breathing by unloading the respiratory muscles through assisting the inspiratory phases and counterbalancing the intrinistic positive end expiratory positive pressure (ipeep)(3).</p>
            <p>Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a new method of closed loop ventilation which can switch back between pressure support and pressure control modes of ventilation. Based on the ideal body weight and % of minute volume ventilation given, the ASV mode choses the best tidal volume and respiratory rate according to the patient lung mechanics by calculating expiratory time constant (RCe) through expiratory flow volume curve(6). Since closed loop system, being a completely automated system, prevent frequent adjustment by clinician and thereby increasing the time and capacity of medical staff. The first application of such closed loop system in mechanical ventilation was done by saxton in1953 in iron lung for regulation of etCO2(7). Studies published on ASV as non-invasive mode of ventilation is limited. In a feasibility study, it has been shown that ASV can be used in non-invasive mode of ventilation with similar results to PSV in COPD patients(8).</p>
            <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are periods of acute worsening during the course of illness which increase hospital admission and mortality. Intensive care unit admission and mortality are higher among elderly and those with co-morbidities(9).

                Non-invasive methods of ventilation can be used in mild to moderate exacerbation of COPD. They prevent most of the complications of invasive mechanical ventilation and has also reduces mortality in acute exacerbations of COPD. In mild to moderate COPD exacerbations(pH-7.25 to 7.35), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) failure rate is found to be 15% to 20%. In severe COPD exacerbations, NIV failure rate approaches upto 52% to 62%(9).</p>
            <p>Adaptive support ventilation:</p>
            <p>Adaptive support ventilation is a closed loop ventilation in which it provides both pressure support and pressure controlled ventilation as per the patient needs(10). The mode was first described by Hewlett in 1977 in form of mandatory minute ventilation with adaptive pressure control(11). Later Dr. fleur T Tehrani invented this mode, which was later introduced in Galileo ventilator(11). This mode supports patient with pressure support when patient has spontaneous breath and when target ventilation is not reached it delivers pressure control breath to achieve adequate ventilation. In this mode, minute volume is controlled via Vt/RR combination based on respiratory mechanics of the patient to keep the work of breathing at minimum(10). This mode calculates the tidal volume and respiratory rate to be delivered by otis equation in its algorithm after %minute volume being set by the clinician to ensure effective ventilation at the alveolar level. The inputs provided by the clinician in this mode is %minute volume based on ideal body weight, ETS, flow trigger, maximum pressure limit(12).</p>
            <p>NIV-PSV:</p>
            <p>Mechanical ventilation in its first form was used at the end of 1930s called tank ventilator. Later in 1950s during the polio epidemics, modern mechanical ventilators began to emerge. Intermittent positive pressure application via anaesthesia mask in treatment of acute respiratory illness was studied in motley and colleagues at Bellevue hospital in 1940s. The first application of NIV as CPAP via nasal mask to obstructive sleep apnea patients was done by Sullivan et. Al in 1981. Successful application of NIV via full face mask for respiratory failure in COPD patients, heart failure patients in 1989 avoided intubation. The use of NIV has increased with the introduction of ventilators with effective compensation for air leaks. NIV are most commonly used in obstructive sleep apnea, COPD and cardiac failure patients and to some extent in failed extubation. Although invasive mechanical ventilation has kept the NIV at second place, still it is used in above clinical settings(16).</p>
