            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <h4>Brief Summary</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Rationale: RAS 130 is an anti-diabetic agent used to lower the blood glucose level in Type II Diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent diabetes) patients with proper diet and exercise. RAS 130 works by restoring proper response to insulin in the body. RAS 130 acts primarily by increasing insulin sensitivity which improves glycemic index. It is presumed that RAS 130 does not cause cardiovascular side effects if it is given to Type II diabetes mellitus patients leading a healthy life style. Specifically, controlling diet is done according to American Diabetic Association & American Heart Association guidelines and also through doing aerobic exercises. Guideline for aerobic exercise is given in the design of the study.<br />
                Exercise is helpful in controlling body weight which can lower the risk for heart disease. Diabetes itself is one of the compounding factors for heart diseases. Exercise helps lowering the LDL cholesterol and raising the HDL cholesterol which is required to prevent heart diseases and achieve a better quality of life.</p>

            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <hr />
            <h4>Primary Objective:</h4>
            <p>To determine the relatedness of cardio toxicity as a side effect in subjects with DM II who are treated with RAS 130 who either met, or failed to meet the criteria for diet and exercise.</p>
            <p>Hypothesis I: There will be no evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are determined to have maintained proper diet and exercise "healthy lifestyle" throughout the study.</p>
            <p>Hypothesis II: There may be evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are determined to neglect proper diet and exercise "unhealthy lifestyle" throughout the study.</p>
            <h4>Secondary Objective:</h4>
            <p>To determine the effectiveness of RAS 130 on the reduction of blood glucose levels in subjects with DM II.</p>
            <p>Hypothesis III: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose levels as a single agent.</p>
            <p>Hypothesis IV: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose in combination with other anti- diabetic agents.</p>
