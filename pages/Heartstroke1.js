            <h4>Brief Summary</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>The overarching goal of this study is to develop, implement, and evaluate the effect of a collaborative quality improvement (C-QIP) intervention (consisting of non-physician health workers, text messages for a healthy lifestyle, and a clinical decision support system) on processes of care and clinical outcomes among individuals with previous cardiovascular disease in India.</p>
            <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Specific objectives of this study are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To describe current practices, context, challenges, and opportunities regarding chronic management of cardiovascular disease from the patient, caregiver, provider, and health administrator perspectives in India.</li>
                <li>To assess the transferability of components of internationally successful multifaceted quality improvement strategies and chronic care models to the Indian healthcare context.</li>
                <li>To conduct a pilot study to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and implementation fidelity of the C-QIP strategy among individuals with cardiovascular disease attending out-patient clinics in India.</li>
                <li>Among individuals with cardiovascular disease, evaluate the effect of C-QIP strategy on processes of care and clinical outcomes, health-related quality of life, and costs at 1 year compared with usual care.</li>
