            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <h4>Brief Summary</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>The study will be carried out on 50 consecutive consenting patients of systemic sclerosis with PAH recruited from outpatient department of internal medicine and rheumatology clinic of PGIMER, Chandigarh, India It is a single centre double blind randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of upfront dual therapy (sildenafil and bosentan) vs monotherapy (sildenafil) Participants will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to one of treatment arms. Placebo and PDE-5 inhibitors 20 mg BD to 60 mg if patient tolerates the drug well to one study arm and PDE-5 inhibitors plus ER antagonist 62.5 to max of 125 to other study group</p>
            <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>All patients fulfilling the SSc classification criteria of American College of Rheumatology during the study period will be screened for presence of PAH. Diagnosed cases of PAH based on CD echo with PAP greater than 35mmHg based on echocardiography will be enrolled in study.Baseline NYHA functional class and 6 min walk distance in meters will be assessed. Heamogram and LFT will be measured Patients will be assessed at two weeks for side effects/safety issues. 6MWT and NYHA functional class will be reassessed at 3 months and 6 months.2D echo will be done at 6 months to measure mPAP RandomizationAll eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in blocks of ten between the two arms. Randomization will be stratified based on severity of PAH. The drugs will be labelled as A and B randomly by another staff member, who will not be involved in deciding the treatment of the study subjects. The randomization sequence will be generated using computer random number generator.</p>
            <p>Statistical analysis- Intention to treat analysis will be carried for the primary and secondary outcomes. For continuous outcomes, unpaired t-test and for dichotomous outcomes chi-squares test with Yate's correction will be used. P less than 0.05 will be considered significant</p>
