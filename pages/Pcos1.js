            <hr />
            <p>This study is undertaken to compare effectiveness of homoeopathic treatment versus integrated approach of homoeopathy and yoga in the treatment of menstrual disorders in females with Polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>
            <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex metabolic, endocrine and reproductive disorder affecting approximately 5-10% of the female population in developed countries. The developing countries like China and India, undergoing rapid nutritional transitions due to westernised diets and lifestyle also indicate similar prevalence (9.13%). Its prevalence among infertile women is 15%-20%. The aetiology of Polycystic ovarian syndrome remains unclear; however, several studies have suggested that Polycystic ovarian syndrome is X-linked dominant condition.Women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome have abnormalities in the metabolism of androgens and oestrogen and in the control of androgen production. High serum concentrations of androgenic hormones, such as testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), may be encountered in these patients. However, individual variation is considerable, and a particular patient might have normal androgen levels.</p>
            <p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome is also associated with peripheral insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and obesity amplifies the degree of both abnormalities. Insulin resistance in Polycystic ovarian syndrome can be secondary to a post binding defect in insulin receptor signalling pathways, and elevated insulin levels may have gonadotropin-augmenting effects on ovarian function. In addition, insulin resistance in Polycystic ovarian syndrome has been associated with adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates lipid metabolism and glucose levels. Both lean and obese women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome have lower adiponectin levels than women without Polycystic ovarian syndrome .</p>
            <p>The diagnostic criteria of the syndrome were revised by the Rotterdam European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), where the following criteria were established: oligo/amenorrhea, clinical and biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and sonographically confirmed Polycystic ovarian syndrome. . Diagnostic criteria for Rotterdam diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome.</p>
